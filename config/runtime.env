# ===================== Intent arbitration strategy (runtime, no rebuild) =====================
# Choose how INTENT (motion vs. speak) and MOTION MATCHING are decided:
# - openai_only : OpenAI decides first and also chooses the motion file from YAML (no local fallback). ← default
# - openai_first : OpenAI decides & matches first using the YAML; if it doesn’t choose a motion quickly, local fuzzy fallback runs.
# - local_first : Try local fuzzy match against YAML (respecting thresholds). If no match, ask OpenAI to choose based on the same YAML.

# ===================== Mic Source Selection (single-switch) =====================
# Flip ONLY this variable to choose the active input mic at runtime:
# - robot  : use the existing robot multicast mic (current repo behavior)
# - mobile : use the mobile app multicast mic (same Wi-Fi via wlan0)

# The following are advanced knobs (change only if you need to). You DO NOT
# need to touch these when switching sources; only flip AUDIO_INPUT_SOURCE.
